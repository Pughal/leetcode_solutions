There is an undirected graph with n nodes, where each node is numbered between 0 and n - 1. 
You are given a 2D array graph, where graph[u] is an array of nodes that node u is adjacent to. 
More formally, for each v in graph[u], there is an undirected edge between node u and node v. The graph has the following properties:

There are no self-edges (graph[u] does not contain u).
There are no parallel edges (graph[u] does not contain duplicate values).

If v is in graph[u], then u is in graph[v] (the graph is undirected).
The graph may not be connected, meaning there may be two nodes u and v such that there is no path between them.

A graph is bipartite if the nodes can be partitioned into two independent sets A and B such that every edge in the graph connects a node in set A and a node in set B.

Return true if and only if it is bipartite.

```
Input: graph = [[1,2,3],[0,2],[0,1,3],[0,2]]
Output: false
Explanation: There is no way to partition the nodes into two independent sets such 
that every edge connects a node in one and a node in the other.
```

Example 2:

![image](https://github.com/Pughal/leetcode_solutions/assets/22728867/cfaa55de-edc2-4722-aa0b-72ae43c185ac)

```
Input: graph = [[1,3],[0,2],[1,3],[0,2]]
Output: true
Explanation: We can partition the nodes into two sets: {0, 2} and {1, 3}.
```

Constraints:
```
graph.length == n
1 <= n <= 100
0 <= graph[u].length < n
0 <= graph[u][i] <= n - 1
graph[u] does not contain u.
All the values of graph[u] are unique.
If graph[u] contains v, then graph[v] contains u.
```
