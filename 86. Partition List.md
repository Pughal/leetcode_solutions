Given the head of a linked list and a value x, partition it such that all nodes less than x come before nodes greater than or equal to x.

You should preserve the original relative order of the nodes in each of the two partitions.

 

Example 1:

```
Input: head = [1,4,3,2,5,2], x = 3
Output: [1,2,2,4,3,5]
```

Example 2:
```
Input: head = [2,1], x = 2
Output: [1,2]
```

Constraints:
```
The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 200].
-100 <= Node.val <= 100
-200 <= x <= 200
```

Python

```
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def partition(self, head: Optional[ListNode], x: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        beforeHead = ListNode(0)
        afterHead = ListNode(0)
        before = beforeHead
        after = afterHead

        while head:
            if head.val < x:
                before.next = head
                before = head
            else:
                after.next = head
                after = head
            head = head.next

        after.next = None
        before.next = afterHead.next

        return beforeHead.next
```



TestCase 1:
```
Input
head =
[1,4,3,2,5,2]
x =
3
Output
[1,2,2,4,3,5]
Expected
[1,2,2,4,3,5]
```

TestCase 2:
```
Input
head =
[2,1]
x =
2
Output
[1,2]
Expected
[1,2]
```
