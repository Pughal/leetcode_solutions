Given a directed acyclic graph, with n vertices numbered from ```0``` to ```n-1```, and an array edges where ```edges[i] = [fromi, toi]``` represents a directed edge from ```node fromi to node toi```.

Find the smallest set of vertices from which all nodes in the graph are reachable. It's guaranteed that a unique solution exists.

Notice that you can return the vertices in any order.

 

Example 1:

![image](https://github.com/Pughal/leetcode_solutions/assets/22728867/8ebf9549-9ca7-4002-a4af-04ebf898a46c)

```
Input: n = 6, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[2,5],[3,4],[4,2]]
Output: [0,3]
Explanation: It's not possible to reach all the nodes from a single vertex. 
From 0 we can reach [0,1,2,5]. From 3 we can reach [3,4,2,5]. So we output [0,3].
```

Example 2:

![image](https://github.com/Pughal/leetcode_solutions/assets/22728867/eec33f68-e5cd-4d6b-9497-b07ce57f04a4)

```
Input: n = 5, edges = [[0,1],[2,1],[3,1],[1,4],[2,4]]
Output: [0,2,3]
Explanation: Notice that vertices 0, 3 and 2 are not reachable from any other node, 
so we must include them. Also any of these vertices can reach nodes 1 and 4.
``` 

Constraints:
```
2 <= n <= 10^5
1 <= edges.length <= min(10^5, n * (n - 1) / 2)
edges[i].length == 2
0 <= fromi, toi < n
All pairs (fromi, toi) are distinct.
```

    return [i for i, d in enumerate(inDegree) if d == 0]

        in_degree_by_node = [0] * n
        # go over each edge in the graph 
        for edge in edges : 
            # increment the in degree of the receiving node 
            in_degree_by_node[edge[1]] += 1 
        # build your smallest set of vertices
        # these are your sources in the graph 
        # sources will be nodes in a directed acyclic graph that have no in degree 
        return [index for index, value in enumerate(in_degree_by_node) if value == 0]
