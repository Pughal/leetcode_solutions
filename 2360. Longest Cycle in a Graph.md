### Hard

You are given a directed graph of n nodes numbered from 0 to n - 1, where each node has at most one outgoing edge.

The graph is represented with a given 0-indexed array edges of size n, indicating that there is a directed edge from node i to node edges[i]. 
If there is no outgoing edge from node i, then edges[i] == -1.

Return the length of the longest cycle in the graph. If no cycle exists, return -1.

A cycle is a path that starts and ends at the same node.

 

Example 1:

```
Input: edges = [3,3,4,2,3]
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest cycle in the graph is the cycle: 2 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2.
The length of this cycle is 3, so 3 is returned.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: edges = [2,-1,3,1]
Output: -1
Explanation: There are no cycles in this graph.
```

Constraints:
```
n == edges.length
2 <= n <= 10^5
-1 <= edges[i] < n
edges[i] != i
```

Python

```
class Solution:
  def longestCycle(self, edges: List[int]) -> int:
    ans = -1
    time = 1
    timeVisited = [0] * len(edges)

    for i, edge in enumerate(edges):
      if timeVisited[i]:
        continue
      startTime = time
      u = i
      while u != -1 and not timeVisited[u]:
        timeVisited[u] = time
        time += 1
        u = edges[u]  # Move to next node
      if u != -1 and timeVisited[u] >= startTime:
        ans = max(ans, time - timeVisited[u])

    return ans
```

TestCase 1:
```
Input:
edges = [3,3,4,2,3]
Output:
3
Expected:
3
```

TestCase 2:
```
Input:
edges = [2,-1,3,1]
Output:
-1
Expected:
-1
```
