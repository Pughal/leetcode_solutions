Given a m x n grid filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top left to bottom right, which minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path.

Note: You can only move either down or right at any point in time.

 

Example 1:

```
Input: grid = [[1,3,1],[1,5,1],[4,2,1]]
Output: 7
Explanation: Because the path 1 → 3 → 1 → 1 → 1 minimizes the sum.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: grid = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]
Output: 12
``` 

Constraints:
```
m == grid.length
n == grid[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 200
0 <= grid[i][j] <= 100
```

Python

```
class Solution:
  def minPathSum(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    m = len(grid)
    n = len(grid[0])

    for i in range(m):
      for j in range(n):
        if i > 0 and j > 0:
          grid[i][j] += min(grid[i - 1][j], grid[i][j - 1])
        elif i > 0:
          grid[i][0] += grid[i - 1][0]
        elif j > 0:
          grid[0][j] += grid[0][j - 1]

    return grid[m - 1][n - 1]
```

```
class Solution:
    def minPathSum(self, grid):
        m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        dp = [0] * n
        for i in range(m):
            dp[0] += grid[i][0]
            for j in range(1, n):
                dp[j] = (min(dp[j], dp[j-1]) or dp[j-1]) + grid[i][j]
        return dp[-1]
```

TestCase 1:
```
Input:
grid = [[1,3,1],[1,5,1],[4,2,1]]
Output:
7
Expected:
7
```

TestCase 2:
```
Input:
grid = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]
Output:
12
Expected:
12
```
