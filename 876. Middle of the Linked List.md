Given the head of a singly linked list, return the middle node of the linked list.

If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.

 

Example 1:

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [3,4,5]
Explanation: The middle node of the list is node 3.
```

Example 2:

![image](https://github.com/Pughal/leetcode_solutions/assets/22728867/572d52df-7fc5-4f14-bbcd-27aa87b43bd0)

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: [4,5,6]
Explanation: Since the list has two middle nodes with values 3 and 4, we return the second one.
``` 

Constraints:
```
The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 100].
1 <= Node.val <= 100
```

TestCase 1:
```
Input
head =
[1,2,3,4,5]
Output
[3,4,5]
Expected
[3,4,5]
```

TestCase 2:
```
Input
head =
[1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output
[4,5,6]
Expected
[4,5,6]
```
