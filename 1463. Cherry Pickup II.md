### Hard

You are given a rows x cols matrix grid representing a field of cherries where grid[i][j] represents the number of cherries that you can collect from the (i, j) cell.

You have two robots that can collect cherries for you:

 - Robot #1 is located at the top-left corner (0, 0), and
 - Robot #2 is located at the top-right corner (0, cols - 1).
   
Return the maximum number of cherries collection using both robots by following the rules below:

 - From a cell (i, j), robots can move to cell (i + 1, j - 1), (i + 1, j), or (i + 1, j + 1).
 - When any robot passes through a cell, It picks up all cherries, and the cell becomes an empty cell.
 - When both robots stay in the same cell, only one takes the cherries.
 - Both robots cannot move outside of the grid at any moment.
 - Both robots should reach the bottom row in grid.
 

Example 1:

```
Input: grid = [[3,1,1],[2,5,1],[1,5,5],[2,1,1]]
Output: 24

Explanation: Path of robot #1 and #2 are described in color green and blue respectively.
Cherries taken by Robot #1, (3 + 2 + 5 + 2) = 12.
Cherries taken by Robot #2, (1 + 5 + 5 + 1) = 12.
Total of cherries: 12 + 12 = 24.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: grid = [[1,0,0,0,0,0,1],[2,0,0,0,0,3,0],[2,0,9,0,0,0,0],[0,3,0,5,4,0,0],[1,0,2,3,0,0,6]]
Output: 28

Explanation: Path of robot #1 and #2 are described in color green and blue respectively.
Cherries taken by Robot #1, (1 + 9 + 5 + 2) = 17.
Cherries taken by Robot #2, (1 + 3 + 4 + 3) = 11.
Total of cherries: 17 + 11 = 28.
``` 

Constraints:
```
rows == grid.length
cols == grid[i].length
2 <= rows, cols <= 70
0 <= grid[i][j] <= 100
```
