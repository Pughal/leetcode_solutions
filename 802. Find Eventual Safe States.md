There is a directed graph of n nodes with each node labeled from 0 to n - 1. 
The graph is represented by a 0-indexed 2D integer array graph where graph[i] is an integer array of nodes adjacent to node i, 
meaning there is an edge from node i to each node in graph[i].

A node is a terminal node if there are no outgoing edges. 
A node is a safe node if every possible path starting from that node leads to a terminal node (or another safe node).

Return an array containing all the safe nodes of the graph. The answer should be sorted in ascending order.

 
Example 1:

![image](https://github.com/Pughal/leetcode_solutions/assets/22728867/d3aed9c1-0a19-4c4e-b4ff-9f1abeb0e054)

```
Input: graph = [[1,2],[2,3],[5],[0],[5],[],[]]
Output: [2,4,5,6]
Explanation: The given graph is shown above.
Nodes 5 and 6 are terminal nodes as there are no outgoing edges from either of them.
Every path starting at nodes 2, 4, 5, and 6 all lead to either node 5 or 6.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: graph = [[1,2,3,4],[1,2],[3,4],[0,4],[]]
Output: [4]
Explanation:
Only node 4 is a terminal node, and every path starting at node 4 leads to node 4.
```

Constraints:
```
n == graph.length
1 <= n <= 10^4
0 <= graph[i].length <= n
0 <= graph[i][j] <= n - 1
graph[i] is sorted in a strictly increasing order.
The graph may contain self-loops.
The number of edges in the graph will be in the range [1, 4 * 10^4].
