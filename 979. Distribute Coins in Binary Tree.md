You are given the root of a binary tree with n nodes where each node in the tree has node.val coins. There are n coins in total throughout the whole tree.

In one move, we may choose two adjacent nodes and move one coin from one node to another. A move may be from parent to child, or from child to parent.

Return the minimum number of moves required to make every node have exactly one coin.

 

Example 1:

![image](https://github.com/Pughal/leetcode_solutions/assets/22728867/a3479121-ad2e-4fd0-95be-10d89468c4cc)

```
Input: root = [3,0,0]
Output: 2
Explanation: From the root of the tree, we move one coin to its left child, and one coin to its right child.
```

Example 2:

![image](https://github.com/Pughal/leetcode_solutions/assets/22728867/3cfa9097-f1af-4a83-a5f7-efa5acb4cb38)

```
Input: root = [0,3,0]
Output: 3
Explanation: From the left child of the root, we move two coins to the root [taking two moves]. Then, we move one coin from the root of the tree to the right child.
``` 

Constraints:
```
The number of nodes in the tree is n.
1 <= n <= 100
0 <= Node.val <= n
The sum of all Node.val is n.
```
