### Hard

You are given three integers n, m and k. Consider the following algorithm to find the maximum element of an array of positive integers:

You should build the array arr which has the following properties:
```
 - arr has exactly n integers.
 - 1 <= arr[i] <= m where (0 <= i < n).
 - After applying the mentioned algorithm to arr, the value search_cost is equal to k.
```

Return the number of ways to build the array arr under the mentioned conditions. As the answer may grow large, the answer must be computed modulo 109 + 7.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: n = 2, m = 3, k = 1
Output: 6
Explanation: The possible arrays are [1, 1], [2, 1], [2, 2], [3, 1], [3, 2] [3, 3]
```

Example 2:
```
Input: n = 5, m = 2, k = 3
Output: 0
Explanation: There are no possible arrays that satisify the mentioned conditions.
```

Example 3:
```
Input: n = 9, m = 1, k = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: The only possible array is [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
```

Constraints:
```
1 <= n <= 50
1 <= m <= 100
0 <= k <= n
```
