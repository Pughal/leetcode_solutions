You are given the head of a non-empty linked list representing a non-negative integer without leading zeroes.

Return the head of the linked list after doubling it.

 

Example 1:
![image](https://github.com/Pughal/leetcode_solutions/assets/22728867/205ff04d-36b4-4585-a2ea-9b1200cebc92)

```
Input: head = [1,8,9]
Output: [3,7,8]
Explanation: The figure above corresponds to the given linked list which represents the number 189. Hence, the returned linked list represents the number 189 * 2 = 378.
```

Example 2:

![image](https://github.com/Pughal/leetcode_solutions/assets/22728867/7686dbff-34ff-457a-8aca-9e79b023ae5b)
```
Input: head = [9,9,9]
Output: [1,9,9,8]
Explanation: The figure above corresponds to the given linked list which represents the number 999. Hence, the returned linked list reprersents the number 999 * 2 = 1998. 
``` 

Constraints:
```
The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 10^4]
0 <= Node.val <= 9
The input is generated such that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros, except the number 0 itself.
```
