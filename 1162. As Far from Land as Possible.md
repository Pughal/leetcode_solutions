Given an ```n x n``` grid containing only values 0 and 1, where 0 represents water and 1 represents land, 

find a water cell such that its distance to the nearest land cell is maximized, and return the distance. 

If no land or water exists in the grid, return -1.

The distance used in this problem is the Manhattan distance: the distance between two cells ```(x0, y0) and (x1, y1)``` is ```|x0 - x1| + |y0 - y1|```.

 

Example 1:

```
Input: grid = [[1,0,1],[0,0,0],[1,0,1]]
Output: 2

Explanation: The cell (1, 1) is as far as possible from all the land with distance 2.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: grid = [[1,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,0]]
Output: 4
Explanation: The cell (2, 2) is as far as possible from all the land with distance 4.
```

Constraints:
```
n == grid.length
n == grid[i].length
1 <= n <= 100
grid[i][j] is 0 or 1
```
