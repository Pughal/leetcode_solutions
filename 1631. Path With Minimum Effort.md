You are a hiker preparing for an upcoming hike. 
You are given heights, a 2D array of size rows x columns, where heights[row][col] represents the height of cell (row, col). 
You are situated in the top-left cell, (0, 0), and you hope to travel to the bottom-right cell, (rows-1, columns-1) (i.e., 0-indexed). 
You can move up, down, left, or right, and you wish to find a route that requires the minimum effort.

A route's effort is the maximum absolute difference in heights between two consecutive cells of the route.

Return the minimum effort required to travel from the top-left cell to the bottom-right cell.

 

Example 1:

![image](https://github.com/Pughal/leetcode_solutions/assets/22728867/faf8ae6c-5514-463b-9d4d-78f20ac32196)

```
Input: heights = [[1,2,2],[3,8,2],[5,3,5]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The route of [1,3,5,3,5] has a maximum absolute difference of 2 in consecutive cells.
This is better than the route of [1,2,2,2,5], where the maximum absolute difference is 3.
```

Example 2:

![image](https://github.com/Pughal/leetcode_solutions/assets/22728867/ca812381-5a2d-4b50-b96d-fa540fb4ec84)

```
Input: heights = [[1,2,3],[3,8,4],[5,3,5]]
Output: 1
Explanation: The route of [1,2,3,4,5] has a maximum absolute difference of 1 in consecutive cells, which is better than route [1,3,5,3,5].
```

Example 3:

![image](https://github.com/Pughal/leetcode_solutions/assets/22728867/a01d854e-e3a6-4ebd-930b-fd14e0bb62a3)

```
Input: heights = [[1,2,1,1,1],[1,2,1,2,1],[1,2,1,2,1],[1,2,1,2,1],[1,1,1,2,1]]
Output: 0
Explanation: This route does not require any effort.
``` 

Constraints:
```
rows == heights.length
columns == heights[i].length
1 <= rows, columns <= 100
1 <= heights[i][j] <= 10^6
```
