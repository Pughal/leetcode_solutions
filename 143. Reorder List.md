You are given the head of a singly linked-list. The list can be represented as:
```
L0 → L1 → … → Ln - 1 → Ln
```
Reorder the list to be on the following form:
```
L0 → Ln → L1 → Ln - 1 → L2 → Ln - 2 → …
```
You may not modify the values in the list's nodes. Only nodes themselves may be changed.

 

Example 1:

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [1,4,2,3]
```

Example 2:

![image](https://github.com/Pughal/leetcode_solutions/assets/22728867/c1cb6da4-b948-4abb-95a2-04dfaef09377)

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [1,5,2,4,3]
``` 

Constraints:
```
The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 5 * 10^4].
1 <= Node.val <= 1000
```
