Given the head of a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of the list and return its head.

 

Example 1:

![image](https://github.com/Pughal/leetcode_solutions/assets/22728867/d6b50355-d7bf-4dd1-aaa8-a9fe8efa6e4d)

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], n = 2
Output: [1,2,3,5]
```

Example 2:
```
Input: head = [1], n = 1
Output: []
```

Example 3:
```
Input: head = [1,2], n = 1
Output: [1]
```

Constraints:
```
The number of nodes in the list is sz.
1 <= sz <= 30
0 <= Node.val <= 100
1 <= n <= sz
```
