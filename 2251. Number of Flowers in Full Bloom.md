## Hard

You are given a 0-indexed 2D integer array flowers, where ```flowers[i] = [starti, endi]``` means the ith flower will be in full bloom from starti to endi (inclusive). 
You are also given a 0-indexed integer array people of size n, where people[i] is the time that the ith person will arrive to see the flowers.

Return an integer array answer of size n, where answer[i] is the number of flowers that are in full bloom when the ith person arrives.


Example 1:

```
Input: flowers = [[1,6],[3,7],[9,12],[4,13]], poeple = [2,3,7,11]
Output: [1,2,2,2]
Explanation: The figure above shows the times when the flowers are in full bloom and when the people arrive.
For each person, we return the number of flowers in full bloom during their arrival.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: flowers = [[1,10],[3,3]], poeple = [3,3,2]
Output: [2,2,1]
Explanation: The figure above shows the times when the flowers are in full bloom and when the people arrive.
For each person, we return the number of flowers in full bloom during their arrival.
``` 

Constraints:
```
1 <= flowers.length <= 5 * 10^4
flowers[i].length == 2
1 <= starti <= endi <= 10^9
1 <= people.length <= 5 * 10^4
1 <= people[i] <= 10^9
```

SIMULATION APPROACH
On each iteration we have 3 possible events happening, and we need to perform the one that happens first:
1. Flower blooms (i.e. we do blooming_flowers += 1)
2. Person arrives (i.e. we do seen_flowers[person] = blooming_flowers)
3. Flower finishes blooming (i.e. we do blooming_flowers -= 1)

If a flower blooms in the same time a person arrives, we first pick the blooming (i.e. that person gets to see that flower).
If a flower finishes blooming in the same time a person arrives, we first pick the person arrival (i.e. that person gets to see that flower).

We keep track of bloom_endings with a heap. We can sort flowers and people (without losing the index that identifies the person) or put them into heaps and then start popping.

flowers = [[1,10],[3,3]]
people = [3,3,2]

bloom_times = [[1,10],[3,3]]
arrivals = [(2,2),(3,0),(3,1)]

flower = 0
arrival = 0
seen_flowers = [0 for _ in range(len(people))]
blooming_flowers = 0
bloom_endings = [] (heap)

First iteration:
We compare bloom_times[flower], arrivals[arrival] and bloom_endings[0] (depending if len(bloom_endings) > 0).
We pick the smaller one, in this case, flowers.
We do:
- blooming_flowers = 1.
- flower = 1
- bloom_endings = [10]

Second iteration:
Now we pick an arrival with t = 2.
We do:
- seen_flowers[2] = 1
- arrival = 1

Third iteration:
Now we pick the blooming with t = 3.
We do:
- blooming_flowers = 2.
- flower = 2 (reached end of array)
- bloom_endings = [3,10]

Fourth iteration:
Now we pick the arrival with t = 3 of person index=0.
We do:
- seen_flowers[0] = 2
- arrival = 2

Fourth iteration:
Now we pick the arrival with t = 3 of person index=1.
We do:
- seen_flowers[1] = 2
- arrival = 3 (reached end of array)

Fifth iteration:
Now we pick the bloom ending with t = 3.
We do:
- blooming_flowers = 1.

Sixth iteration:
Now we pick the bloom ending with t = 10.
We do:
- blooming_flowers = 0.

We finish as we have reached the ending of both arrays and the heap is empty.
